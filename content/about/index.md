# About

Hello there, I'm Manu.

I'm a software developer from Elche (Spain). I worked as a full stack
developer at [Stackscale](https://stackscale.com). A few months ago I
decided to leave my job and focus some time with the goal of improve
my English. My initial idea included moving to London, but the Covid-19
situation made me rethink the plan.

If you are interested in my resume, you can take a look [here](/resume)
