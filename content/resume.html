<p><em>December 2020 - Present</em></p>

<p>As a member of the integration team, I take part in the development of all of
our services. From the backend (.NET) to the frontend (Angular) and mobile
(Angular with Ionic).</p>

<p>Right now, I&#8217;m working on Smart Planner. With Smart Planner, the user (business,
restaurants, &#8230;) can specify resources, jobs, constraints and get real-time
scheduling of those jobs.</p>

<p>Technology used: .NET, C#, Typescript, Angular, Ionic, SQL Server.</p>

<p><em>November 2017 - March 2020</em></p>

<p>I participated in the development of the internal applications for the company
to manage the infrastructure and the automation of processes. Also, I contribute
to creating a control panel for the clients in which they could manage their
invoices, see their resources and open tickets with support.</p>

<p>During this time I learned that, as a developer, knowing the business
domain can have a big impact on the success of the project.</p>

<p>Technology used: Python, Django, MySQL, Celery, RabbitMQ, Javascript, Vue and Docker.</p>

<p><em>January 2017 - Octoboer 2017</em></p>

<p>I helped with the development of a web application to help the marketing
department to do an analysis of the companies in Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>We made a system to get data of the companies from different sources and then
the marketing team could search for companies by characteristics (number of
employees, cities, &#8230;) and offer different services.</p>

<p>Technology used: PHP, Symfony, MySQL, Docker, RabbitMQ and ElasticSearch.</p>

<p><em>March 2016 - December 2016</em></p>

<p>The research department wanted to go to different places around the world and
interview with people. But, that was expensive in money and resources. To
resolve the issue, we develop a system in which the researchers could draw an
area on a map and select different sources (Twitter, Instragram, Google
places,&#8230;). Then, the application would start to retrieve data about the
area. The data was stored in Elasticsearch to be searchable.</p>

<p>My tasks consisted to investigate and implement the communications with the
third-party APIs, store the data and make the interface for the research team to
see the results.</p>

<p>Technology used: Java, Spring, ElasticSearch, ActiveMQ and Javascript.</p>
