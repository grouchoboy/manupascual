# Resume

## Work expericence

### [Nouss Intelligence](https://www.noussintelligence.com/)

*December 2020 - Present*

As a member of the integration team, I take part in the development of all of
our services. From the backend (.NET) to the frontend (Angular) and mobile
(Angular with Ionic).

Right now, I'm working on Smart Planner. With Smart Planner, the user (business,
restaurants, ...) can specify resources, jobs, constraints and get real-time
scheduling of those jobs.

Technology used: .NET, C#, Typescript, Angular, Ionic, SQL Server.

### [Stackscale](https://www.stackscale.com/) 

*November 2017 - March 2020*

I participated in the development of the internal applications for the company
to manage the infrastructure and the automation of processes. Also, I contribute
to creating a control panel for the clients in which they could manage their
invoices, see their resources and open tickets with support.

During this time I learned that, as a developer, knowing the business 
domain can have a big impact on the success of the project.

Technology used: Python, Django, MySQL, Celery, RabbitMQ, Javascript, Vue and Docker.

### [Freemedia Internet (Adsalsa)](https://www.adsalsa.com/en/)

*January 2017 - Octoboer 2017*

I helped with the development of a web application to help the marketing
department to do an analysis of the companies in Spain and Portugal.

We made a system to get data of the companies from different sources and then
the marketing team could search for companies by characteristics (number of
employees, cities, ...) and offer different services.

Technology used: PHP, Symfony, MySQL, Docker, RabbitMQ and ElasticSearch.

### Building Sciences and Urbanism Deparment (University of Alicante)

*March 2016 - December 2016*

The research department wanted to go to different places around the world and
interview with people. But, that was expensive in money and resources. To
resolve the issue, we develop a system in which the researchers could draw an
area on a map and select different sources (Twitter, Instragram, Google
places,...). Then, the application would start to retrieve data about the
area. The data was stored in Elasticsearch to be searchable.

My tasks consisted to investigate and implement the communications with the
third-party APIs, store the data and make the interface for the research team to
see the results.

Technology used: Java, Spring, ElasticSearch, ActiveMQ and Javascript.
